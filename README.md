# Retro-Snake
Version 2.0.0

# About the Game

Control the snake with simple taps!

Retro-Snake is a clean and modern take on the timeless classic, built entirely in Java using Android Studio.
Designed to be lightweight and responsive, the game runs smoothly on nearly all Android devices.

Move the snake using on-screen direction buttons as it glides across a grid. Every time you grab a piece of food, the snake grows longer and the challenge increases. One wrong move and the game ends!

BE CAREFUL! Avoid hitting the walls or running into your own tail — one collision ends the run instantly.

Give it a try & see how long you can survive with your reflexes!

# This game is absolutely free, light-weight, easy to play, and compatible with most Android phones.
Improvement in Version 2.0.0 : Audio has been added to the Retro Snake game which was not present in Version 1.0.0 or Version 1.1.0 . A bug has been fixed which was causing a crash in case Snake collides with the food.
